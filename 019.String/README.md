Imagine you're in your classroom at school, and your teacher asks you to write a story about your summer vacation. You decide to write about the time you went to the beach with your family.

To write your story, you'll need to use a lot of words. You'll need words like "beach", "vacation", "family", and so on. In JavaScript, each of these words is called a `string`.

A string is just a series of characters that represents some text. Just like you can use words to tell a story, you can use strings to write code.

For example, let's say you want to write a program that prints out the message "I had a great time at the beach!" to the screen. You could use a string to represent this message, like this:

```
'I had a great time at the beach!'
```


In this case, the string is just a bunch of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) that are enclosed in quotes. The quotes tell JavaScript that everything inside them is a string.

You can use strings to do all sorts of things in JavaScript. For example, you can use them to display messages to the user, to store data, and to build up more complex programs.
