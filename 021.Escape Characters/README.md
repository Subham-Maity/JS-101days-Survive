In JavaScript, an escape character is a character that is used to represent a character that cannot be typed directly from the keyboard. Escape characters are typically used to specify special characters in a string, such as newlines, tabs, and quotation marks.

There are several escape characters in JavaScript that can be used in strings. Here is a list of some of the most commonly used escape characters:

```
let str = 'This string includes all of the escape characters: \', \", \\, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, and \v';
console.log(str);
// Output: "This string includes all of the escape characters: ', ", \, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, and \v"
```


The `\'` escape character is used to insert a single quote, the `\"` escape character is used to insert a double quote, the `\\` escape character is used to insert a backslash, the `\b` escape character is used to insert a backspace, the `\f` escape character is used to insert a form feed, the `\n` escape character is used to insert a newline, the `\r` escape character is used to insert a carriage return, the `\t` escape character is used to insert a tab, and the `\v` escape character is used to insert a vertical tab.
