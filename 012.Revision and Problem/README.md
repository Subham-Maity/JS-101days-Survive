let age = prompt("Please enter your age:");
age = parseInt(age); // convert the age to an integer
 
if (age >= 13 && age <= 19) {
console.log("Your age is between 13 and 19");
} else {
console.log("Your age is not between 13 and 19");

let age = 15;
 
switch (true) {
case age >= 13 && age <= 19:
console.log("Your age is between 13 and 19");

console.log("Your age is not between 13 and 19");

```
let number = 12;
 
if (number % 2 == 0 && number % 3 == 0) {
console.log(`${number} is divisible by 2 and 3`);
} else {
console.log(`${number} is not divisible by 2 and 3`);
}
 
```


This code will check if the value of the number variable is divisible by 2 and 3 by using the modulo operator to calculate the remainder of number divided by 2 and 3. If both remainders are equal to 0, it will print a message saying that the number is divisible by 2 and 3. If either remainder is not equal to 0, it will print a message saying that the number is not divisible by 2 and 3.

For example, if the value of number is 12, the code will output: "12 is divisible by 2 and 3"

You can also use the logical OR operator (||) to check if the number is divisible by 2 or 3:

```
if (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0) {
console.log(`${number} is divisible by 2 or 3`);
} else {
console.log(`${number} is not divisible by 2 or 3`);
}
```


This will check if the value of the number variable is divisible by 2 or 3 by using the modulo operator to calculate the remainder of number divided by 2 and 3. If either remainder is equal to 0, it will print a message saying that the number is divisible by 2 or 3. If both remainders are not equal to 0, it will print a message saying that the number is not divisible by 2 or 3.
